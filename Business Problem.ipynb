    "Kasaragod district is one of the 14 districts in the southern Indian state of Kerala. Kasaragod became part of Kannur district following the reorganisation of states due to predominance of Malayalam speakers. Kasaragod was declared as a district on 24 May 1984. At the same time, Kanyakumari district was separated from Kerala. Read more about Kasargod district here:-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasaragod_district.\n",

    "The endosulfan tragedy which occurred in Kasaragod district is now well known. It is considered by many experts in the field of pesticide toxicity as one of the worst pesticide disasters to happen to a region and its people. Still, the victims are living in Kasaragod district.

    "During Monsoon season diseases like Chikungunya, Dengue, Rat fever, Viral fever are very common among People. They depend mainly to Government District Medical Hospital, Chemmattamvayal, Kasaragod. But it lacks advanced medical facilities and shortage of efficient doctors. Diagnosing centres present in the different hospitals of the district lack to diagnose Virus-like H1N1, Nipah, Zika Virus etc. We used to send the sample to the Manipal Institute of Virology. Due to a large number of samples from different parts. Put our sample in a queue. Around 4-5 days requires to diagnose these type of Viruses. Above middle-class family members depends on Private Hospitals. The situation of private hospitals is also similar. If the condition of the patient is severe, they prescribe to any Private Hospital in Mangalore.\n",

    "We lack advanced medical facility in our district. A Government medical college will provide better treatment for Endosulfan victims as well as people suffering serious health issues. The medical college will transform the image of our district. Very fewer hospitals are available in our district. We depend on Private hospitals in Mangaluru City. So, Here, I will find the most suitable place for a Government medical college. I have to find a suitable place in Kasaragod district in such a way that Medical students and Doctors in the newly established Hospital should access basic necessities."
